This is simply the explanation of how to compile and use the program.

to run the program, just compile gcd-assignment-csc-2400-002.cpp. then run the executable. it will ask for inputs and print
each gcd method used and the result.

g++ gcd-assignment-csc-2400-002.cpp -o gcd
example: 
gcd 42 12
extended euler:  gcd(42, 12) = 6 ---- x = 1, y = -3: 42*1 + 12*-3 = 6
consecutive euler:  gcd(42, 12) = 6
prime method:  gcd(42, 12) = 6
